# mpu9250
A node.js library for communicating with the MPU9250 by BENKHADRA Hocine (https://github.com/miniben-90/mpu9250)
This sketch contains also a light "rest api server" (server.js) which offers 10 sensor's captures for each call.
example.js is a non-server example. 
Both (server.js and example.js) need to have the sensor calibrated (calibrate_accel.js, calibrate_gyro.js, calibrate_mag.js)
